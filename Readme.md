mkdir healthcare-chatbot-backend
cd healthcare-chatbot-backend

# Initialize npm and install dependencies
npm init -y
npm install @google/generative-ai express cors natural compromise dotenv helmet express-rate-limit winston

# Install development dependencies
npm install --save-dev nodemon jest supertest

# Create the server file (copy the backend code provided)

module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
